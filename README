- If it is the first time working on the project do not forget to bundle install

- Make an account in AWS and copy the bucket keys to the .env file as following:

    AWS_REGION=
    AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

-Maybe the schema might be convoluted so I recommend to do a db:drop db:create db:migrate before coding

- (AndrÃ©) - build a migration in 08/08 -> Table/Model TAG and  wrote the Seed although
            i could not seed the tables cause USERS were necessary to it.
            20180808151608 CreateTags: migrated

            - 20180808152855 CreateMyTags - a second migration
