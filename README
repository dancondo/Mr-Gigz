- If it is the first time working on the project do not forget to bundle install

- Make an account in AWS and copy the bucket keys to the .env file as following:
  
    AWS_REGION=
    AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

-Maybe the schema might be convoluted so I recommend to do a db:drop db:create db:migrate before coding
